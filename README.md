The datasets could not be included in the github repo because of its size restriction. 

Here are the datasets:

TON_IoT dataseet (original): [https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/toniot-datasets](url)

Only the processed_IoT datasets are being used from these datasets.

The training dataset after preprocessing the original dataset: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MgB-34qfbxZdscYfn8eN_Oq5kwmIvYc2?usp=sharing](url)

Using all of the 7 data files in the training code might take a lot of time. Minimum 2 files can be choosen for training to prove that the FL framework actually works with data with different characteristics.
